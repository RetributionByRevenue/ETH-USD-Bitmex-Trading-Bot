What is this?
I anticipate many viewers of this page to be complete scrubs and incompent algo traders, so i took the liberty to configure a portable and containerized python enviroment making it so new people can instantly compile and excicute my included programs without issues. Fundamntally speaking, it would be too difficult for python beginners to install such things as TA-LIB and Pandas Dataframe, so this should be all new python users defacto python envirmoent otherwise. 

How does it work?
Just open spyder.exe and load bitmex_tradingbot.py. (Yes that's all you need to do.)  Due to the nature of Winpython being portable and containorized (easy for me to share), there is no need to install anything.  All you need to do is download and extract the python trading enviroment from the download link provided. 

What does the trading bot do?
Demonstrates how to connect to the bitmex api, supports leverage, useage of trading technical indicators, web scraping, very smart logic regarding algo and market state management(most import thing here), order take profits, and order stop losses.

What's the catch? 
This works on windows. If you are using linux, then you are smart enough to complie the code. Rip mac users(unless you are python girl :3 ).

Fundmentally speaking, this trading bot is a skeleton or a blank canvas. It is up to you to provide the skeleton with a smart brain among other things in order to take your algo trading to the next level. This trading bot here is only 300 lines of code, but the one i use in real life is 1700 lines of code so there is much to be added such as machine learning.
